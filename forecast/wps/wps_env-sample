# The main (root) WPS directory. If it is not defined it
#   defaults to the directory where the "run_wps.sh" script
#   is located.

#####
# GEOG_DIR: The full path to the WPS Geography data
# DATA_DIR: The full path(s) to the GFS, SST, ... data
#           used to create the WRF input files.
#           All the data can be in a single directory or
#           they can be stored in multiple directories.
#           NOTE: The sequence of the directories should
#                 exactly follow the sequense defined for
#                 the variable DATA_TYPE (see below)

# The dates for "start" and "end" of the simulation.

#####
# DATA_TYPE: The sequence of the data types to be used
#            for the creation of the WRF input files.
#            Can be one or more of the WRF default Vtable.*:
#              AGRWRF ARW ARWP AWIP CFSR2_WEB ECMWF
#              ERA-INTERIM.ML ERA-INTERIM.PL GFDL GFS
#              GGODAS GSM NAM NARR NCEP2 NNRP NOGAP
#              TCRP UKMO_LANDSEA SST
#            or user supplied data types (accompanied by the Vtables)
# DATA_PFX:  The prefix(es) used in the datafile names
#              (same sequense with DATA_TYPE sequense).
#            This makes easier to identify what data to use
#              (do not include the date portion in the filename).
# DATA_SFX:  The suffix(es) used in the datafile names
#              (usually the file extension, or the string after
#               the date part of the filename)
#            NOTE: If only one suffix is supplied it will be assigned to all
#                  data filenames. Multiple suffixes should again follow
#                  the order defined in DATA_TYPE
# DATE_EXPR: The regular expression for the date in the data filenames
#            Can be one or more of: YMDH YMD MDYH MDY DMYH DMY YJH YJ
#            where: Y denotes the presence of the year
#                     in the date part of the data filename
#                   M denotes the presence of the month of the year
#                     in the date part of the data filename
#                   D denotes the presence of the day of the month
#                     in the date part of the data filename
#                   H denotes the presence of the hour of the day
#                     in the date part of the data filename
#                   J denotes the presence of the day of the year
#                     in the date part of the data filename
#            NOTE: If only one date expression is supplied it will be assigned
#                  to all data filenames. Multiple date expression should again
#                  follow the order defined in DATA_TYPE
# DATA_INTERVAL: The time interval in hours between consecutive data records
#                  (mainly for the WRF atmospheric forcing data).
#                Data contained in the DATA_DIR are all scanned regardless the
#                  the value of  DATA_INTERVAL.
#                DATA_INTERVAL is used to (a) include at least an extra record
#                  before and after the simulation times and (b) to modify the
#                  variables "interval_seconds" and "auxinput4_interval" in the
#                  "namelist" files.
#                It can be: 0< DATA_INTERVAL <= 24, default: 6 (usually 1, 3 or 6)
